# AlgorithmsPython
This is a collection of some algorithms I've found useful or instructive that I've written in Python.

This collection contains:
- `RootFinders.py`
	- Exhausive Enumeration (least efficient)
	- Bisection/Binary Search (more efficient)
	- Newton-Raphson/Successive Approximation (most efficient)
